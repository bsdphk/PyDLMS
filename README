This is code to read data from your ulility (Electricity, Water, Gas etc)
meter using the optical infrared two-way port.

You need an IR LED, a IR photodiode and some kind of amplifying circuit
to connect this to your serial port.

iec1107.py contains old code to talk the simple IEC1107 protocol
which a lot of meters fortunately understand.

example.py and the rest of it is a minimal DLMS implementation
which manages to pull data out of my L&G E450 meter.

Please do not email me if this doesn't work for you, unless you
include a patch or pull-request that improves it.

Be warned that the DLMS protocol stack is created by a succession
of morons, doing one stupid thing after another for several decades.

If you need more DLMS than this code offers, consider what GuruX
has to offer.
